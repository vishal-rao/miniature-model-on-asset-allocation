# miniature-model-on-asset-allocation
We wanted to see how would a optimisation Algorithm i.e Hungarian Algorithm for assignment problem's would assign units for a portfolio. <br> So we have used YahooFinance libary to collect historical data of top 10 companies based on market cap from 5 sectors. Data was collected and average of average value of quarter is calculated which would be the input for the Hungarian Algorithm. <br> The stocks were segregated as low , medium and high risk based on their volatity i.e . deviation from the mean the stock are rank corelated in sectors and then as a whole based on the risk appetite the stocks were selected considering lower ranks i.e from 1 considered the most risky <br> Finally the selectyed stocks historical data would be collcetd dynamically using the datetime moddulkeuel anmd these would be the input for the hungarian algorithm. <br> The results were not fruit full as we found drawbacks on using the hungarian algorithm that allotemnt of units were biased based on the price of the stock.
